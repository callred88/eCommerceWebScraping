# eCommerceWebScraping

Starting the project.


What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?

I had some issues with the learning the wait sequence and the web driver.
Some of the challenges were on the coding side to scrape the page.



What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?

I gained the knowledge of there is no one superior brand when it comes to number of reviews. Also the price vs review does not come into play either. For example, there could be a high priced laptop with low number of reviews.
